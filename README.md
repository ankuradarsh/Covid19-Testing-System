## About The Project

(https://github.com/ankuradarsh/Covid19-Testing-System/blob/master/covid19-website.png?raw=true)

Developed a dedicated website aimed at providing comprehensive support to individuals affected by Covid-19, incorporating state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology. This innovative platform prioritizes accessibility by integrating voice-activated features, enabling patients to navigate and interact seamlessly.

The user-friendly design of the website ensures a smooth experience, offering valuable assistance across various aspects of the healthcare journey for those impacted by Covid-19. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, the frontend is meticulously crafted to be visually appealing and responsive, enhancing the overall user experience.

On the backend, PHP powers a robust system that seamlessly integrates with a MYSQL database, ensuring efficient data management. To further enhance user interaction, cutting-edge Annyang.js is employed for automated voice recognition. This comprehensive technology stack not only guarantees a user-friendly interface but also facilitates efficient data processing, proving particularly beneficial for individuals navigating the website during the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic.
